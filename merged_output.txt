Respected Selection Committee,

I am writing to express my strong interest in participating in the EPFL Summer Research Program. As a final-year Information Technology student at Government Engineering College, Bhavnagar, I have developed a deep passion for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Agentic AI systems. Through my academic projects and internship experience, I have cultivated both technical expertise and a strong curiosity for applying AI to solve real-world problems — especially those related to sustainability and intelligent automation.

During my internship at CSRBBOX (IBM SkillBuild), I worked on developing agentic AI architectures using LangChain, Gemini/OpenAI APIs, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). This experience strengthened my understanding of prompt engineering, LLM orchestration, and AI system design, while also teaching me the importance of safe and reliable AI agent behavior.

I have also built several research-oriented projects such as:

EcoMate, an agentic AI for climate action (SDG 13),

VisionEarth, a CNN-based satellite image classifier, and

AgroEye, an ML-based crop health prediction system.
These projects reflect my interest in applying AI for sustainability, automation, and environmental monitoring.

EPFL’s interdisciplinary research environment and commitment to innovation deeply resonate with my academic goals. I am particularly drawn to the opportunity to work alongside leading researchers, gain exposure to advanced AI tools, and contribute to impactful projects that bridge research and real-world application. I believe this experience will not only enhance my technical and analytical skills but also prepare me for future graduate research in AI and Intelligent Systems.

I am confident that my background in Machine Learning, Computer Vision, and Agentic AI, combined with my enthusiasm for collaborative research, makes me a strong candidate for this program. I am eager to bring my skills, curiosity, and dedication to EPFL’s vibrant research community.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to learn, contribute, and grow at EPFL.

Sincerely,
Tirthkumar Avaiya
