Respected Selection Committee,

I am writing to express my strong interest in participating in the EPFL Summer Research Program. As a final-year Information Technology student at Government Engineering College, Bhavnagar, I have developed a deep passion for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Agentic AI systems. Through my academic projects and internship experience, I have cultivated both technical expertise and a strong curiosity for applying AI to solve real-world problems — especially those related to sustainability and intelligent automation.

During my internship at CSRBBOX (IBM SkillBuild), I worked on developing agentic AI architectures using LangChain, Gemini/OpenAI APIs, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). This experience strengthened my understanding of prompt engineering, LLM orchestration, and AI system design, while also teaching me the importance of safe and reliable AI agent behavior.

I have also built several research-oriented projects such as:

EcoMate, an agentic AI for climate action (SDG 13),

VisionEarth, a CNN-based satellite image classifier, and

AgroEye, an ML-based crop health prediction system.
These projects reflect my interest in applying AI for sustainability, automation, and environmental monitoring.
